Typescript & tailwing manual updated:



tailwind ccs && typescript:

1. npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript !!
2. npm i -D tailwindcss postcss-cli autoprefixer 
2.5 npm i -D  postcss !
3. npx tailwind init tailwind.js --full (all settings will be visible) 
(for some reason has to be tailwind.js not tailwind.config.js!)
4. change tailwind.js name, so it won't work anymory, but all settings can be checked
5. npx tailwind init tailwind.js 
(this time without -- full flag -> in this file we will put only our custom settings)
6. postcss.config.js -> 

const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
module.exports = {
  plugins: [tailwindcss("./tailwind.js"), require("autoprefixer")],
};

7.  src/assets/main.css

    src/assets/tailwind.css
    @import "tailwindcss/base";
    @import "tailwindcss/components";
    @import "tailwindcss/utilities";

8. delete both .ccs file in root, delete react logo

9. package.json:

"start": "npm run watch:css && react-scripts start",
"build": "npm run build:css && react-scripts build",
   ...
"build:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css",
"watch:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css"

10. Tailwind css intelisense extension (reinstall if not working)

11.  index.tsx 

    import './assets/main.css';

!!!!!
12. after every change in config file (tailwind.js) run npm run build:css
(run it once at the beginning!)
!!!!!

13. purgecss when finished with the project?
53. RSS -> proxy server or fetching from backend


NOTES: 
1. Tab logic setTabEditOpenedData(tabID) & setTabColorOpenedData(tabID) crucial;
2. make background extend with the content: min-h-screen! (min-height: 100vh;)
  for image: bg-cover bg-fixed(so the image doesn't scale with contene, )
3. Last Gap in a Column - 
 Column: overflow-hidden & Gap: h-full (height: 100%) not working because EditTab
 and edit bookmakr need overflow
 solution: absolute invisible last gap stretching screen height
