3. npx tailwind init tailwind.js --full (all settings will be visible)

4. change tailwind.js name, so it won't work anymory, but all settings can be checked
5. npx tailwind init tailwind.js 
(this time without -- full flag -> in this file we will put only our custom settings)

module.exports = {
  plugins: [tailwindcss("./tailwind.js"), require("autoprefixer")],
};

   ...
"build:css": "postcss src/assets/tailwind.css -o src/assets/main.css",
